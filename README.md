# Web-Projects
A sample of web projects developed.

buy.php is a simple shopping cart application that allows the user to enter a search term. The search term is then used to look through eBay listings. The results are then displayed allowing the user to build a shopping list.

map.html and map.js allow a user to search for property information retrieved using a Zillow API.

music.html and music.js allow a user to look up artist information retrieved using an API provided by last.fm.

pong.html and pong.js allow a user to play a game of Pong.
